# README
 This is a project to learn Django. It's based on the Django Girls tutorial: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/

 To run it, we first need to enable the project's virtual environment like this: `source ./myvenv/bin/activate`. This runs a shell script that modifies the console session PATH and other environment variables to set up our 'virtual environment'.

 To exit the current virtualenv, we have a shell script available in the path called `deactivate`.

 To run Django commands we use the manage.py script. For instance, to run the server we need to enter `python manage.py runserver`
